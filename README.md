## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

I used these two repositories to guide me on the Remix path.
- [NBA Remix](https://github.com/willianjusten/nba-remix) from Willian Justen
- [Indie Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack) from Remix
